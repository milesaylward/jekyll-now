My journey to my first Blog post, and the battle to resist Pokemon Go!

Well this marks my very first entry into my newly developed blog/portfolio! Yay let’s all cheer! Just kidding about my blog ending all other blogs by the way, other blogs feel free to carry on without fear. My main goal for this blog is to share my experiences, difficulties, and eventual triumph while learning to code and land a job as a Jr. Developer, hopefully somewhere on the west coast. I started to learn to code when I realized after working in almost every position in the restaurant biz that I couldn’t continue working till the dead of night, not knowing what a weekend or holiday away from work was like, including Christmas and birthdays, and going years without being able to visit family due to low pay and high demand for employees to work well over 40 hours per week. I researched and researched for jobs that did not necessarily require degrees as I have already been to and paid for culinary school heading back into the college system for a few more years seemed like it wasn’t the right way to go. I eventually stumbled onto <a href="https://skillcrush.com" target="_blank">Skillcrush</a> (a fantastic informational website for anyone looking for information on coding or getting into the tech field). It was here where I learned that web developers didn’t need degrees just the ability to demonstrate their coding skills to potential employers. This was my ‘eureka’ moment. My first college major, before leaving due to financial reasons, was Computer Science I took the web to find out if this was something I could do. Enter <a href="https://bento.io" target="_blank">Bento.io</a> (which is more a track that leads to other sites but groups them in an order very beneficial for beginners) created by self-taught Stack Overflow developer Jon Chan. I spent hours on Bento moving through the tracks, admittedly faster than I probably should have but I was a man on a mission. Within a week I had developed my first site. A rough map of a blog/portfolio website, kind of like this one! I was hooked! I had to build more, I had to learn more but the majority of the learning I had done was through reading, which worked fine for the simple concepts of HTML and CSS but as I pushed into Ruby on Rails and Python I felt more assisted learning would be beneficial for me. I contemplated Coding Bootcamps but ultimately realized the price was just too high for what I could afford. A friend let me know about <a href="https://teamtreehouse.com" target="_blank">Treehouse</a> (a video based learning site that features courses on almost every language you could want) and I was in love with their videos. They helped me grasp things that initially seemed almost impossible to understand. I’ve been coding with Treehouse for a little over a month and have completed both the HTML and CSS tracks and just began the Python track with video teacher Kenneth Love. But I was de-railed for about 2 weeks by the monster know as 
![Pokemon Logo](/images/pokemon_go_logo.png). I was dedicating all my late night coding time trying to be the best there ever was. Funny enough when I had my last day at my job recently I was given a Pokemon cake as a going away gift lol. I guess I was talking about it a lot recently. I have since gained a better handle on myself and learned to balance my need to code with my obsession over Pokemon and the few hours of sleep I allow myself between the two. I plan to stay the course and learn everything I can along the way! Any ideas, tips, or tricks for learning more efficiently are always greatly appreciated, and I am far from an expert but if you have questions I’d be more than happy to answer them. Until next time, keep working hard and never stop coding!
